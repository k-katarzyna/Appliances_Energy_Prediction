The additional data were scraped to provide holiday dates. 
Ultimately, it was decided that using a `holidays` library is 
more convenient for adding holiday information to the analyzed 
dataset. However, this information was retained as it can serve 
as a handy reference for holidays, observances, and other details, 
such as clock changes in Belgium.
